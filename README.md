CoronaWannApp
=============

A little script that helps you estimate the severity of a Corona-Warn-App
notifaction by providing the exact time and date of potentially infectious
encounters.

Uses an `exposures.db` sqlite3 file that can e.g. be exported from the
microG exposure notification implementation.
